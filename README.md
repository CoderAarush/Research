The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has created unprecedented demand for specialized AI infrastructure. 

“Neoclouds,” GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) providers, complement traditional hyperscalers by delivering AI-optimized compute, storage, and networking. This study systematically evaluates neoclouds (CoreWeave, Lambda Labs, Together AI) versus hyperscalers (AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle Cloud), focusing on GPU architectures (NVIDIA H100/H200, AMD MI300, TPUs), interconnects (Ethernet vs. InfiniBand), and AI optimization techniques including quantization, LoRA, and Adam variants. 

It assesses multi- tenant efficiency, memory utilization, and energy consumption. Results from industrial reports show that neoclouds achieve up to 75 per cent faster LLM performance and significantly lower energy costs through hardware-software co-optimization, including tailored memory allocation, mixed-precision computation, and optimized inter-node communication. This study highlights trade-offs in latency, cost, and scalability between neoclouds and hyperscalers, providing actionable insights for enterprises seeking high-performance, cost-effective AI infrastructure.
